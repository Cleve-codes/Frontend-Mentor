## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In this project I learnt on CSS grid, some styling methods and responsiveness.


```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus on learning responsiveness and making good UI/UX. I'm planning to learn preloarders then bootstrap in order to make better and more responsive webpages



### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.freecodecamp.com) - This helped me for CSS grid reason. I really liked the way they teach and their style of styling CSS. Moving forward I will be using it to learn new concepts.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.javatpoint.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Grid and flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
